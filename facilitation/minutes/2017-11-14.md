**Present:** Rebecca, Dan, Shireen, Zooey, Aisha, Yvonne

### Nazareth

- Switched teams for weeks 3-4
- Added the objects + arrays challenge
- Parallel challenge was really hard

### Gaza

- Ghada has joined the team as local CF, with focus on classroom
- Zooey is focusing on organisational support, QA 
- Added a refresher on Git flow to week 2
- Workshops have gone well, mix of English and Arabic
- Presentations were all in English
- No time in schedule for business development, sorting out how to prep for second half projects
- First set of pastoral care meetings week 2

### London

- Business development has revolved around thinking about second half projects - might be worth thinking about how this could fit into the six month programme in Gaza
- Students have divided into groups - one developing a site, one putting together a description of the offering, one researching clients, etc.
- Repo organised with labels and other descriptors so all understand where the leads have come from
- Students are keep to experiment with the CAST payment model, where organisations pay a deposit before the free sprint, which they can apply to a post-grad sprint or get back after the process
